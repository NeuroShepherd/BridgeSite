  BRIDGE is a clinical informatics platform for providers that links to the UCSF electronic health record (EHR) and performs real-time computations of individual patients’ data at the time of the clinical visit. Delivering the most updated, comprehensive, and relevant clinical information to providers is vital for delivering world-class individualized patient care. The UCSF BRIDGE platform is designed to bring the latest research-level computations into clinical care by providing dashboard visualizations and quantified views of patient data from within the UCSF APeX (Epic) EHR. Our innovative approach allows providers to quickly and efficiently view the patient’s longitudinal disease trajectories, compare the patients with normative reference groups, examine quantified imaging results, and more.
