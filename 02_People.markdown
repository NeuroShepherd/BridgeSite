#### <center> Kate Rankin, PhD <center>

<p align="center">
Dr. Kate Rankin is a Professor in the UCSF Department of Neurology who specializes in the neuropsychological and neurologic underpinnings of human socioemotional behavior in aging and neurodegenerative disease.  In her work at the UCSF Memory and Aging Center Dr. Rankin developed a battery of socioemotional tests that was adopted at the national level by the NIH Alzheimer’s Disease Coordinating Centers to improve diagnostic accuracy for dementia syndromes. More recently she was part of the NIH-AA committee defining the international framework for the diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease. Her research utilizes quantitative structural and functional brain imaging to examine the neural substrates of empathy, theory of mind, personality, and the comprehension of social signals for sarcasm and deception.  She also specializes in the development of strategies for aggregating cross-disciplinary data and analytic processes across labs and institutions to facilitate scientific collaboration, and has led the data/biostatistics and bioinformatics cores of a number of center grants and privately funded research consortiums. She is a leader with the UCSF-wide Precision Medicine initiative, and advises on a number of UCSF committees and boards promoting digital health and computational strategies for improving research and clinical care.
