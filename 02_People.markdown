#### <center> Riley Bove, MD <center>

<center>
Dr. Riley Bove is Assistant Professor of Neurology, and Chief of Innovation in the UCSF Department of Neurology’s Center for Multiple Sclerosis and Neuroinflammation. She completed a degree in Anthropology at Harvard College (Phi Beta Kappa), and through a Fulbright grant in Mali. She obtained her MD from Harvard Medical School in 2007, completed her residency in the combined Massachusetts General Hospital – Brigham and Women’s Hospital Neurology program, a clinical research fellowship at the Partners MS Center, and a Masters Degree through Harvard Medical School’s Clinical Investigator Training Program. She has received research support from the NIH and the National MS Society, among others. Dr. Bove joined the UCSF Faculty in 2015. Her research centers on developing new approaches to improving function in multiple sclerosis, including through hormonal regulation, and through technology (digital therapeutics, telemedicine, EMR-based research, precision medicine approaches). Her publication record can be found <a href="https://profiles.ucsf.edu/riley.bove">here</a> and <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/myncbi/riley.bove.1/bibliography/49587169/public/?sort=date&direction=ascending">here</a>.

#### <center> Kate Rankin, PhD <center>

<p align="center">
Dr. Kate Rankin is a Professor in the UCSF Department of Neurology who specializes in the neuropsychological and neurologic underpinnings of human socioemotional behavior in aging and neurodegenerative disease.  In her work at the UCSF Memory and Aging Center Dr. Rankin developed a battery of socioemotional tests that was adopted at the national level by the NIH Alzheimer’s Disease Coordinating Centers to improve diagnostic accuracy for dementia syndromes. More recently she was part of the NIH-AA committee defining the international framework for the diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease. Her research utilizes quantitative structural and functional brain imaging to examine the neural substrates of empathy, theory of mind, personality, and the comprehension of social signals for sarcasm and deception.  She also specializes in the development of strategies for aggregating cross-disciplinary data and analytic processes across labs and institutions to facilitate scientific collaboration, and has led the data/biostatistics and bioinformatics cores of a number of center grants and privately funded research consortiums. She is a leader with the UCSF-wide Precision Medicine initiative, and advises on a number of UCSF committees and boards promoting digital health and computational strategies for improving research and clinical care.

#### <center> Stephan Sanders, PhD <center>

<p align="center">
Dr. Sanders trained as a pediatric physician at Nottingham and London in the UK before undertaking a PhD and postdoctoral research position at Yale. His research focuses on using genomics and bioinformatics to understand the etiology of human disease, especially autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Using SNP genotyping arrays on samples in the Simons Simplex Collection he clarified the important role of de novo copy number variation (CNVs) in ASD.
