<font size="5"><center><b>Mission Statement</b></center></font>

The BRIDGE application was designed for clinicians, by clinicians to improve patients’ quality of care, accuracy of diagnosis, and speed of treatment. Our innovative approach to visualizing medical record data allows providers to quickly and efficiently view patients’ lab values, cross-sectional results, longitudinal disease trajectories, neuroimaging results, and more.

The foundational platform for BRIDGE has four visualization widgets and infrastructure for brain MRI quantification.  We have used these to create clinic-specific dashboards for the Multiple Sclerosis, Memory and Aging, and Child Autism clinics.  

Rather than locking the platform into being useful for just our three clinics, we built BRIDGE from the start to be modular and configurable, so that other clinics could rapidly adapt it to their patients, their questions, and their needs.

We are already working with other clinics within the Weill Institute for Neurosciences to design and build their own dashboards, and we hope to expand beyond these groups until every clinic who wants a BRIDGE dashboard has one.

We also are continuously expanding the functionality of BRIDGE to include new computational widgets.  We are building a timeline viewer, adding brain MRI quantification protocols, bringing in new computational algorithms, and have plans to build widgets for wearable digital data streams (i.e., from smartwatches)
