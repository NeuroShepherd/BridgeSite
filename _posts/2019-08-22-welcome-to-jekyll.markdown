We now have a functional webpage that does not have to be edited through
the Drupal system (i.e. we have a lot more flexibility now). I need to learn
this package, Jekyll, more thoroughly to structure the site how we want it
such as adding photos, making page tabs, etc. I should be able to do more
over the next few weeks!
