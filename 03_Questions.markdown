## How is BRIDGE accessed?
BRIDGE is an EHR-integrated application that is used to view additional dashboards directly alongside patients’ medical records. BRIDGE is accessed as a tab in a patient’s UCSF APeX (EPIC) EHR, access to which requires an authenticated user account at the UCSF Medical Center. Currently, only providers registered to clinics that have worked with the BRIDGE team to design a clinic-specific dashboard can access BRIDGE through their APeX login.

## Is BRIDGE HIPAA compliant?
Yes. Providing a secure environment for patients’ sensitive health information is critical to the mission of the project. To this end, BRIDGE complies with the standards set forth in the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), which requires the implementation of a strong set of administrative, physical, and technical safeguards ensuring the security of patients’ electronic Protected Health Information (ePHI). We have undergone all required regulatory approvals at UCSF to enable our BRIDGE launch link in APeX, demonstrating that we are handling patient data at the required level of security and privacy.

## How can I implement BRIDGE in my UCSF clinic?
We welcome new partner clinics! For successful design and implementation of a BRIDGE dashboard, a new clinic requires a clinical champion with domain expertise who can develop a vision for which quantifications and visualizations are right for that clinic. The first step is for the interested clinicians to discuss this vision with members of the BRIDGE team. If both parties agree upon feasibility, funding, and timeline, then the next steps include determining end-user requirements (e.g., adapting existing visualization widgets and APIs to new data; building new visualization widgets or APIs; integrating new heavy computational analytics). The process and costs to create a dashboard for a new clinic is variable based on these end-user needs.
